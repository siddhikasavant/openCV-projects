Welcome to my little corner of computer vision experiments!
This repo is basically a growing playground where I upload all my OpenCV + dlib + Python mini-projects — from simple detections to fun real-time vision tricks.

I keep adding new stuff as I learn, experiment, and break things (in the best way).
If you’re exploring CV or just vibing with AI, feel free to check out the scripts, use them, remix them — go crazy

## 🚀 What This Repo Is About

- Simple, readable OpenCV implementations

- Real-time webcam-based processing

- Detection, tracking, segmentation & filters

- Facial landmarks, masks, ROIs, overlays

- Random experiments I keep adding over time 

Basically… this is my computer vision diary.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python

- OpenCV

- dlib

- NumPy

(more libraries depending on the experiment)

💡 Got Ideas?

If you have suggestions like:

- blink detection

- smile meter

- virtual lipstick

- real-time filters

- hand detection

- face morphing

…I’m always down to try them :)
